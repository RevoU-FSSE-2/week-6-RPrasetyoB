# Docker
This repository will show you how to create a Dockerfile for your Node application to enable it to run as a Docker container. You should install Docker first to be able to run docker commands.

To create a Docker container, you need to create a Dockerfile on your project. Using that file, you can create a Docker container which can run on any platform without installing any libraries on the actual machine.

Docker allows you to package an application with its environment and all of its dependencies into an encapsulated “box”, called a container. Usually, a container consists of an application running in a stripped-to-basics version of a Linux operating system. An image is the blueprint for a container, a container is a running instance of an image.
